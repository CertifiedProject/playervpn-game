You can QUICKLY fork this repository and deploy through ANYTHING!

# üéÆ Deployment
**PlayerVPN Games is super easy to clone**, this can be hosted anywhere, even **static** site hosts!

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues.
There are A FEW issues:
If you play **AmongUS**, just know **if your device can not run WEBGL it will completely mess up the WHOLE website** for you!


If you **WANT** to play Smash Karts then **go somewhere else until we find out the loading issues**.


For all you **Cookie Clicker** fans out there, **Cookie Clicker** does not disguise as Schoology with it's title. The favicon does work though so I suggest pinning your **Cookie Clicker** tab while your playing!

# üß±Build Now GG
If you are a fan of the game **BuildNowGG**, then do realize that it **will not run on an older version of chromebook**, it should run **FINE** if you are on a **desktop**!

# üîªDown Games
**1: Roblox**

**2: Mario-bros NEW in folder. (New and not gonna link to the website until fixed)**

**3: Subway Surfers in folder. (New and not gonna link to the website until fixed)**

# „äôÔ∏èSecure login
**Added a secure one time login for security reasons (so teachers can not find a way in :))**
