# 🕹️ PVPN Games
We are proud to release our new project PlayerVPN games. Completely out of html, we have made a completely functioning game website.

# 🚀 How to clone?
You can QUICKLY fork this repository and deploy through ANYTHING!

# 🎮 Deployment
**PlayerVPN Games is super easy to clone**, this can be hosted anywhere, even **static** site hosts!

# ⚠️ Issues.
There are A FEW issues:
If you play **AmongUS**, just know **if your device can not run WEBGL it will completely mess up the WHOLE website** for you!


If you **WANT** to play Smash Karts then **go somewhere else until we find out the loading issues**.


For all you **Cookie Clicker** fans out there, **Cookie Clicker** does not disguise as Schoology with it's title. The favicon does work though so I suggest pinning your **Cookie Clicker** tab while your playing!

# 🧱Build Now GG
If you are a fan of the game **BuildNowGG**, then do realize that it **will not run on an older version of chromebook**, it should run **FINE** if you are on a **desktop**!
